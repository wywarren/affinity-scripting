# Affinity Scripting LookSee & Tools

What is in this repo is based on the April 2026 (3.2) release of Affinity.

## Findings
- The MCP server has access to a bunch of documentation that an AI agent can use as reference for creating scripts etc. The `extract_docs.js` script below can extract all these docs and save them locally so you can take a look at them. This includes some example affinity scripts.
- Affinity has a scripts panel (Window > General > Scripts) which lets you see and run scripts created by the AI. However you cannot see the actual script's code, edit it or create your own scripts in the UI. The `script_mgr.js` script below can be used to manage scripts in the library (add, list, save to disk). 
- The documentation tells the AI agent to use `search_sdk_skills` to search for solutions before creating its own. This doesn't actually exist in the list of MCP tools but there is a `search_sdk_hints` tool. The `search_sdk.js` script below can be used to call this tool, just pass it a search query. In my testing the returned results are not that accurate but they will no doubt get better over time, because the description for that tool says _Search a global pool of SDK hints from millions of other MCP sessions. Use it to check for existing solutions to problems you are facing._
- There is a `add_sdk_hint` tool in the MCP which I'm guessing goes hand in hand with `search_sdk_hints` but it's documentation seems to indicate that actually updates the `preamble` doc. 


## Prerequisites
- enable the Affinity MCP connector: https://www.affinity.studio/help/ai-connector-setup/#configure-affinity NOTE: You do not need to set up Claude or the Claude connector
- Node.js installed
- Dependencies installed with `npm install`
- MCP server available at `http://localhost:6767/sse`

## MCP Inspector
To look at the Affinity MCP server and see what it can do, you can use the MCP Inspector tool:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector --sse http://localhost:6767/sse
```

## Scripts

### `extract_docs.js`

Downloads all SDK documentation topics from MCP and saves them under `docs/`, preserving any nested paths returned by the server.

Run:

```bash
node extract_docs.js
```

### `search_sdk.js`

Searches SDK hints using MCP and prints the response to the console.

Run:

```bash
node search_sdk.js "blend mode"
```

### `search_terminal.mjs`

Wraps the `search_sdk.js` into a terminal to continually ask questions.

```bash
node search_terminal.mjs
```

### `script_mgr.js`

Manages scripts in the Affinity script library.

Commands:

```bash
node script_mgr.js list
node script_mgr.js add --title "Hello World" --description  "Says Hello World" --file helloworldexample.js
node script_mgr.js save --title "Hello World"
node script_mgr.js save --title "Hello World" --out exports/hello-world.js
```

- `list`: lists installed library scripts
- `add`: adds a script from a local file
- `save`: reads a library script and saves it to disk

**NOTE**: You cannot delete a script via the MCP so you will need to delete them in Affinity in the scripts panel.

## Markdown import to text frame
`markdown_import_to_text_frame.js` was written using Codex via the Affinity MCP. It imports a markdown file into the currently selected text frame, mapping markdown elements to Affinity text styles. 

You can test it by selecting a text frame in Affinity, running the script (by clicking on it in the scripts panel) and selecting a Markdown file when prompted. **Note**: The Markdown file must be on your desktop for the file picker to be able to select it.

Install with

```bash
node script_mgr.js add --title "Markdown import to selected text frame" --description  "Imports a Markdown file into the selected text frame" --file markdown_import_to_text_frame.js
```



## Using Codex with the Affinity MCP
You need to register the Affinity MCP server with Codex. It does have issues accessing the MCP server over SSE so you need to proxy it via stdio.

```bash
codex mcp add affinity -- uvx mcp-proxy --transport sse http://localhost:6767/sse
```

You will need python and `uv` installed for this to work

## Notes
- The code in this repo was thrown together by Codex as I was tinkering so don't expect any masterful coding here
- Don't use this code or the MCP to do dumb and/or illegal things!
